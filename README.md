# Movie-DB
AngularJS SPA that browses through TMDb website and picks movie titles depending on your search input. 
This is first version of app and still in development and I still plan to add paginations for all data objects from response, better bootstraping of items and other search options like genre, writer, type, rottentomato score etc. Latest addition to app is simple and easy pagination for pages.
